# Project for 2025 'Reboot the world' Ideathon.



Simple Flask server that displays a livestream hosted by the IP Webcam Mobile App. Clicking on the "Capture and Caption" Button clicks a snapshot of the current frame and runs it through a Hugging Face Image captioning model, generating a caption of what the camera sees. Finally, the caption is ran through a TTS module, essentially enabling the user to "hear" what the camera sees.
